"Virtual memory is a memory management technique used in computer systems to allow programs to use more memory than is physically available. It involves dividing the memory into smaller, fixed-size units called pages, and then mapping these pages to corresponding addresses in the system's storage device. When a program requires more memory than is available, the system swaps some of the less-used pages to the storage device, freeing up space in the physical memory. This allows programs to continue running even if there is not enough physical memory available.","Virtual memory is a memory management technique used in computer systems to allow programs to use more memory than is physically available.
